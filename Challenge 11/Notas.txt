	-https://forum.tuts4you.com/topic/43059-helpme-pyarmor-obfuscated-malware/

Knowledge of deobfuscation techniques:
	-Most old versions of unpacking pyarmor, doesnt work.
	-Most likely super mode for unpacking, no available public tooling for this.

-Hint:
	-Instead of trying to break the protection, use basic analysis tooling: 
		-procmon, wireshark, or apimonitor (dynamic instrumentation tooling)
	
	-Noticed:
		-There is dns been requested to www.evil.flare-on.com, using UDP, look at it.
		-Can you emulate this?, probably, take a look at wireshark and procmon.


-Current approach:
	-Find trick to finish 11 (Outside of the box)
	-Find a way to unpack this challenge.
