1.-Se esta usando pyinstaller y pyarmor.
	-Recomendacion obligatoria: Utiliza python 3.7 para unpacking de pyinstaller.

2.-Links deobfuscation pyarmor: (Busca mas y intenta hacer que funcione)
	-https://devilinside.me/blogs/unpacking-pyarmor
	-https://github.com/Svenskithesource/PyArmor-Unpacker
	-https://forum.tuts4you.com/topic/43059-helpme-pyarmor-obfuscated-malware/

Knowledge of deobfuscation techniques:
	-Most old versions of unpacking pyarmor, doesnt work.
	-Most likely super mode for unpacking, no available public tooling for this.

-Hint:
	-Instead of trying to break the protection, use basic analysis tooling: 
		-procmon, wireshark, or apimonitor (dynamic instrumentation tooling)
	-Noticed:
		-There is dns been requested to www.evil.flare-on.com, using UDP, look at it.

	-To communicate further with the bot it is neccesary setting up the DNS server and take in mind the wireshark output.

"Speedrun" Solution:
	-Because I was running out of time and university had me in trouble, I had to found a way to finish this quickly, but I did not knew how.
	-This is when you have to figure out that it is possible to inject python code. Knowing this, you eventually figure out there is an ARC4 class that is missed to implement when you try to run the unpacked PYC file.
	-If you try to print the RC4 key and the plaintext, you will notice one of them contains the flag.
