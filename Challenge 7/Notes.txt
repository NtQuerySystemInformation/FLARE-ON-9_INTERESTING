1.-The core logic followed here is that the operations done inside the JS can be reversed, and
therefore, not need to use z3.

This is because it is mainly using SUM (+), SUB(-) and XOR(^).
You can reverse Sums and Subs, but you couldnt apply the reverse of XOR 
because it leaves the specific array index unmodified.

My script deobfuscate.py does most of the job, but there was one mistake related to whitespaces
that led me to a lot of time wasted (Special thanks to Myrtus for pointing me out this).


Additionally, you could patch the binary so you can make it output what you want in terms of Javascript.
