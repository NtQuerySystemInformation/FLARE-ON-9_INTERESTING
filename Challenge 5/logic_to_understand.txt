Try modify the response as well as understanding how it's being decoded with rc4 and base64. 
The response itself is the encoded flag, which you already have in the pcap

-Core logic:	
	-You already know which methods have the encrypt-decrypt response:
		-You also know the expected responses to solve the challenge.	

	-The ideal way would be:
		-Emulate the network connection:
			1.-Hook the network APIs (make all return as expected, correct)
				-Differenciate based on WinHttpSendRequest.

			2.-for  WinHttpReadData, return the expected response.
			
Solution:
	-Once I was able to rebuild the target object, I had to find a way to interface with the network functionalities of the malware.
	Because of this reason, I learned a new technique that involved setting the domain in hosts file to resolve it to loopback
	and then make an HTTP server that resolves the expected buffer values.
	
	After you have done this, you are able to spot the flag after one of vtable funcions processed the information.
