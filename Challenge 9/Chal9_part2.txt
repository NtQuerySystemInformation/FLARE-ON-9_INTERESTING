-Analiza la funcion posGenPubKey y posGenPrivKey

Questions to answer to be closer to the code:
1.-Does Rsa::posEncryptingBuffer 1st and 2nd arg related to output buffers, and third and fourth are input?
	-Which arg is in charge of the decrypted buffer?  (Test it 3 times)
	1.-First call:
		-first argument is the only one that gives output.
		-Second is unmodified, third is unmodified and fourth is the only one that gives input.
	
	2.-Second call:
		-Second, Third, and Fourth arguments have an input arg.
		-First gives output, so it is confirmed this is the encryption output.

	-Importante:
		-Analiza detalle a detalle la funcion de encriptacion, es demasiado sus.
		-Verifica tu hipotesis, comparalo con el source de RSA que tienes, cual seria el approach correcto?




2.-Is Rsa::MultiplicationOfBlocks logic correct?, is it actually only multiplying?
