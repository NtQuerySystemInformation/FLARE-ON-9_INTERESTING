# FLARE-ON 9 Interesting: The most interesting of the challenges of all FLARE-ON 9! (for me)

RELEASE DATE: 11-11-2022.

This are very basic writeups based on my work during the FLARE-ON 9 CTF, you will notice the original files used to get the flags, as well as the tooling created,
the logic behind it and some of the questions asked to solve it (Special thanks to the guys that have replied to my annoying questions during the hardest challenges)

I specially liked 5, as you will see my IDB :) (It is very clean, and even rebuilded the std::wstring struct just for the challenge, althought it is not 100% accurate)
