# FLARE-ON_9_WORKS

RELEASE DATE:

This are very basic writeups based on my work during the FLARE-ON 9 CTF, you will notice the original files used to get the flags, as well as the tooling created,
the logic behind it and some of the questions asked to solve it (I did asked a lot, and learned a lot of techniques while solving this CTF)
