# FLARE-ON_9_WORKS

RELEASE DATE: 11-11-2022.

This are very basic writeups based on my work during the FLARE-ON 9 CTF, you will notice the original files used to get the flags, as well as the tooling created,
the logic behind it and some of the questions asked to solve it (Special thanks to some of the guys that have helped me in the hardest challenges)

I specially liked 5, as you will see my IDB :)
